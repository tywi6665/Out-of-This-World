    "definition": "A dwarf planet is a planetary-mass object that is neither a true planet nor a natural satellite. That is, it is in direct orbit of a star, and is massive enough for its gravity to compress it into a spherical shape, but has not cleared the neighborhood of other material around its orbit. The term was adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006.",
